      <description>Project Specifications Some Notes about capstone This project was built mainly using Python, Python packages, Tensoflow and Raspberry Pi. All students in the Electrical Engineering program at Texas A&amp;amp;M must complete a sponsored 2 semester capstone program. This is a very involved program usually involving 30-40 hrs of work each week. Each week included constant reporting to supervisors, oral presentations, and laboratory work. While the project is a group project, here I talk about my work on the project, and I how I helped the other members when needed.</description>

      <description>Project Specifications This was an completely optional project for the Data Science for Energy and Power class at Texas A&amp;amp;M. In addition to machine learning, this class focused on time predictive techniques and methodology such as ARMA, SVD, and K-means.
As many consumers begin to move to solar, it is hard to accurately measure the impact of number of panels vs the environmental benefits a solar array create. Many companies might stretch the truth about efficacy, while others may be more conservative in their estimates.</description>
