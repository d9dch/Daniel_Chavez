      <description>Project Specifications Some Notes about capstone This project was built mainly using Python, Python packages, Tensoflow and Raspberry Pi. All students in the Electrical Engineering program at Texas A&amp;amp;M must complete a sponsored 2 semester capstone program. This is a very involved program usually involving 30-40 hrs of work each week. Each week included constant reporting to supervisors, oral presentations, and laboratory work. While the project is a group project, here I talk about my work on the project, and I how I helped the other members when needed.</description>
