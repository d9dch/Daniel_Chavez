      <description>Project Specifications This is a MATLAB and MATLAB app builder project. It was part of ECEN 445, an elective course in Applied Electromagnetics.
The mathematical concept is an exercise in recursive methods. There is a layout of nodes on an X and Y plane. The Z plane is the measure of Potential in volts.
In the middle, there is a simulated microstrip line that reaches about halfway into the viewable area.</description>

      <description>Project Specifications This was an completely optional project for the Data Science for Energy and Power class at Texas A&amp;amp;M. In addition to machine learning, this class focused on time predictive techniques and methodology such as ARMA, SVD, and K-means.
As many consumers begin to move to solar, it is hard to accurately measure the impact of number of panels vs the environmental benefits a solar array create. Many companies might stretch the truth about efficacy, while others may be more conservative in their estimates.</description>

      <title>Traffic Stop Racial and Gender Bias in Texas</title>

      <description>Project Specifications This was the midterm project for a class on Computational Data Science taught by Dr. Jin Tao, a Data Science Guru and excellent researcher at Texas A&amp;amp;M.
As someone who has personally been affected by both systemic and explicit racism, I chose this project with a real interest in the finds. The goal of this project was to identify biases in policing during traffic stops during 2010-2016 in TEXAS.</description>
