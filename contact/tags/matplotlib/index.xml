      <description>Project Specifications This was the midterm project for a class on Computational Data Science taught by Dr. Jin Tao, a Data Science Guru and excellent researcher at Texas A&amp;amp;M.
As someone who has personally been affected by both systemic and explicit racism, I chose this project with a real interest in the finds. The goal of this project was to identify biases in policing during traffic stops during 2010-2016 in TEXAS.</description>
